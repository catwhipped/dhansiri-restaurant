        <h2 class="section-title animate-slide">Where It All Began</h2>
        <p>Dhansiri was born from a single dream: to preserve and share the tastes of our ancestors.  Our founder, Kanaâ€¯Kamrun, learned to cook in her motherâ€™s kitchen in Dhaka, where simmering pots and fragrant spices were part of daily life.  Food was a language of love and a bridge between generations.  As Kana migrated to the United States, she brought with her treasured notebooks filled with family recipesâ€”rich stews cooked slowly in earthen pots, fluffy pilafs scented with cardamom and saffron, and chutneys brimming with green chillies and mangoes.</p>
        <p>For years she cooked these dishes for friends and neighbours, determined to keep her heritage alive.  With the support of her family, she opened Dhansiri so she could share the soul of Bengali cuisine with a wider community.  Today, our restaurant is run by Kana and her children, who are committed to honouring their roots while welcoming every guest as part of the family.</p>
        <p>Every meal we serve is a story of perseverance, memory and growth.  From the first sizzle of spices hitting a hot pan to the last scrape of a saucepot, we infuse each dish with the traditions and warmth of home.  We invite you to join us on this journey and taste the love and history that define Dhansiri.</p>
