        <h2 class="section-title animate-slide">Origins of Bengali Cuisine</h2>
        <p>Bengalâ€™s cuisine is as lush and varied as its landscape.  Fed by the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, the region produces fragrant rice, succulent fish and a bounty of vegetables.  Bengali cooks have long balanced flavoursâ€”pairing heat with sweetness, mustard with coconut, river fish with sour tamarind.  Staples like <em>panta bhat</em> (fermented rice), <em>ilish maach</em> (hilsa fish) and <em>shorshe maach</em> (fish in mustard sauce) celebrate what the rivers and fields provide.</p>
        <p>Over the centuries traders, travellers and rulers introduced new ingredients and techniques, from Portuguese cheese (used to make <em>paneer</em>) to Armenian breads.  Each influence was woven into the local fabric, creating dishes that are uniquely Bengali.  Family recipes were guarded and shared by word of mouth, ensuring that the artistry of spiceâ€‘tempering and slow simmering would endure through generations.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title animate-slide">Mughal Inspirations</h2>
        <p>In the 16th and 17th centuries the Mughal Empire swept across the Indian subcontinent, bringing with it a royal courtly cuisine.  Legendary emperors like Akbar and Shah Jahan dined on elaborate feasts featuring aromatic rice, tender meat and fragrant spices.  Bengal, a wealthy province of the empire, embraced these influences while adding local flavours of mustard, chilli and river fish.</p>
        <p>Many of our most beloved dishes trace their roots to this era.  The <em>kacchi biryani</em>â€”a delicate layering of marinated meat and halfâ€‘cooked rice finished in a sealed potâ€”was said to be a favourite of Emperor Shah Jahan.  <em>Beef tehari</em>, a rustic oneâ€‘pot meal of beef and rice, originated in the kitchens of palace guards who needed hearty sustenance.  And <em>shahi haleem</em> (royal haleem) evolved from the slowâ€‘cooked wheat porridge served during Ramadan, enriched with lentils and shredded beef for nobility.  These dishes remain centrepieces of Bengali celebrations today, carrying the legacy of the Mughal courts and the creativity of Bengali cooks.</p>

        <p>Food plays a central role in Bengali celebrations. From the colourful <em>Pohela Boishakh</em> new year feast to the sweet treats of Durga Puja, meals bring family and friends together. Traditional sweets such as <em>rosogolla</em>, <em>mishti doi</em> and <em>sandesh</em> mark special occasions. Savoury snacks like <em>puchka</em> and <em>chotpoti</em> are enjoyed at street-side stalls, while elaborate rice and curry spreads grace wedding tables.</p>
